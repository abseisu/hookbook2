# Actual time to complete assignment
| Date | Time Started | Time Spent | Work completed |
| :--: | -----------: | ---------: | :------------- |
| 03/12 |      9:00pm |       2:00 | read assignment and drafted an outline of what new files and functions I would need on top of the previous assigment |
| 03/12 |      11:00pm |       0:30 | drafted a high level outline for the two new files specifically related to skills I knew I would be creating |
| 03/13 |      10:00am |       2:00 | modified hookbook.c to accomdate the new command-line arguments and necessary function calls. Did not implement these functions, but I just made sure that everything, at the highest level, that I needed in the main function was there. I then coded solutions to the anomalies, specifically those related to the command-line args|
| 03/13 |      12:00pm |       3:00 | Implemented skills_list.c functions. Most of the functions were drawn from rudimentary Array Lists we covered in lecture, but the sorting and printing functions were particularly challenging |
| 03/13 |      3:00pm |       4:00 | Modified the libhook.c file to account for the fact that we are now reading in from two infiles and reading in line by line for new labels that we have to store |
| 03/13 |      7:00pm |       0:30 | Modified pirate struct to account for new members |
| 03/13 |      7:00pm |       4:00 | Debugging lots and lots of segmentation faults. I used valgrind and placed print statements throughout to identify the problematic lines. There ended up being about a dozen or so problems, so this process was painful and time consuming |
| 03/13 |      11:00pm |       1:00 | Tested code against the autograder, making slight formatting and other edge case adjustments to pass all of them |
|      |              |       17:00 | total time spent |

# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with no one.

# Discussion
This was a very challenging PSET. Not only did it require a strong technical knowledge of C to avoid memory leaks, segmentation faults, and other fatal errors, but it also was organizationally challenging. There were lots of files and functions, and without having the foresight to spend a lot of time outlining my work, I don't think I would have succeeded. 

    Unlike the last PSET, I would say this PSET required the programmer to be particularly mindful of segmenation faults and memory leaks. Because of this, I think I picked up some really strong debugging techniques from this PSET. Overall, I'm really happy I struggled through segmentation fault upon segmentation fault because I've come out of it feeling much more confident about tackling memory leaks and debugging in general.
